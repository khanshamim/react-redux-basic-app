Install Dependencies
Letâ€™s install react and react-dom:
    npm install --save react
    npm install --save react-dom

Then, we need to install the core Redux library:
    npm install --save redux

We also need to install another library when using Redux with React:
    npm install --save react-redux


For our devDependencies, we need to install Babel stuff to use ES6 features in React, Webpack to apply the Babel preprocessing, and Webpack Dev Server to host our application.

    npm install --save-dev babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env babel-preset-react webpack webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin


Our package.json now looks like this:
